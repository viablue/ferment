The I-Ching deck provides many easy methods to consult the oracle. For the cardinal reading, four cards are drawn then studied individually and taken as a whole. 

- Consider a question or intent for your reading.
- Riffle-shuffle the deck six times or shuffle while repeating your question six times.
- Cut the deck once.
- Draw four cards face-down in a circle, starting on the right, then down, left, and up.
- Reveal the cards clockwise starting on the right, in the same order as you drew them.

Each card represents a cardinal direction. This model follows the cultural practice of orienting "up" as north. For your readings, orient the directions however you find appropriate.

East, the direction of the rising sun. South, the path the sun travels through the sky during the day. West, the setting sun. North, the night and the path of the moon.

Follow the cycle of the day represented by the cards and read each in turn. The reading begins with the sunrise, laying out the first point for consideration and establishing a tone for the day. At noon the second card reveals influences over the tone established by the first card. Sunset brings a conclusion to the day and completes the cycle begun at dawn. Night brings the moon and reveals a counterpoint to the day, which may strengthen the meaning established by the first three cards or change its meaning utterly.

In this way, read the cards individually and as a whole and reflect on your original intent for consultation.
