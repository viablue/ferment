With an active sourdough starter


Ratio by volume:

- 4 parts flour
- 2 parts starter
- 1 part water
- A little salt


Amounts for a small week-long loaf:

- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup starter
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 teaspoon salt


Additional ingredients that may be important:

- Oil for greasing bowl for rising
- Cornmeal or semolina flour


Equipment for baking:

- Dutch oven, baking sheet, or pizza stone


Mix flour and salt. Use hands or a wooden spoon to work. Add starter and combine until incorporated with flour. The mixture will be dry and clumpy. Add water and mix well. Dough should be sticky but come together with work. Knead dough until extremely smooth, about 10 minutes or 100-200 kneading repetitions.

Leave covered in a greased bowl in a warm place to rise for about 4 hours. Punch down and shape gently. Let rise for another 2-4 hours before baking.


Loaf in a dutch oven:

Preheat oven to 425ºF with empty dutch oven. Gently tip shaped dough into dutch oven and bake for 15 minutes covered, then a further 10 minutes uncovered or until bread is golden brown. Remove from dutch oven and leave to cool.


Loaf on a baking sheet:

Preheat oven to 425º. Gently tip shaped dough onto baking sheet, using a light dusting of cornmeal or semolina flour to keep it from sticking. Place the baking sheet on a middle rack along with a deep baking pan filled with ice cubes on a lower rack. Bake for appx 25-40 minutes until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.


Pizza crust:

Preheat oven to 425-450ºF. Break off a ball of dough and shape into pizza crust using flour make shaping easier. Add toppings and bake for 10-15 minutes on a metal baking sheet or preheated pizza stone.
