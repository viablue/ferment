 The starter will need some tending but otherwise will take care of itself. Yeast has been found preserved in ancient tombs, so properly stored your starter could outlive you. 



Ratio for starter:

- 1 part flour
- 1 part water


Other essential ingredients:

- clean glass jar
- air
- time


Amounts for regular maintenance:

- add 1oz/30ml each per day to begin a new starter
- add a little more a day or two before making dough

Begin with a small amount of fresh flour and water in a jar with an open lid, left undisturbed away from direct sun where air is free to flow over the jar. Add more fresh flour and water every day. Smell and taste the mixture before mixing in fresh ingredients.

After a day or two it should start to bubble. In few days you should start to taste a tangy sourness, and the flour/water mix will be less like a paste and more viscous or slimy. The sourness will grow in time. The smell should be beery or bready. During warm seasons it may take only a few days to get a thriving starter, in cool seasons it could take a week or more to establish a hardy population of wild yeast.

A crust or layer of liquid may form on the top. This is no problem, just mix it in with the day's fresh flour and water. The normal mix should be smooth and a little thick. Add a little more flour if it gets too thin or a little more water if it gets too thick. If it smells bad or any black areas start to grow on top, throw out the mixture and start again. 

Slow down the process by refrigerating the mixture. At room temperature it will need feeding every day or two. Refrigerated the starter can go a week or more unattended. Dried out starter can be reconstituted by adding a little old dried starter to a new flour/water mixture. Even a little leftover dried starter can jumpstart a new starter quickly.

If you have a good starter you can preserve it by spreading out some of the mixture on a sheet of plastic wrap and leave it to dry out on the counter for a day or two. When the mix is dry and crusty, break it into a bag and freeze or store in a cool dry place.
